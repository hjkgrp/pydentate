    "# pydentate: a graph neural network tool for predicting metal-ligand coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorial serves as an introduction to pydentate, an open-source python-based package for predicting metal-ligand coordination from only SMILES string inputs and generating 3D structures of transition metal complexes with the predicted coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to predict coordinating atom indices from SMILES inputs. For illustrative purposes, a subset of the holdout data from the original paper is used here, which users should replace with their own datasets. The source is available at predict_coordination_number.py and predict_coordinating_atoms.py. Future tutorials will cover structure generation and hemilability prediction.\n",

    "### Step 0: preliminaries\n",
    "pydentate uses graph neural networks to predict metal-ligand coordination. Specifically, the directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) architecture is used to learn an optimal molecular representation, which is then passed through a feed forward network (FFN) for final property prediction. Before message passing, an initial molecular representation is required, which the D-MPNN model iteratively improves upon. This initial representation is defined using basic atomic (e.g., atomic number, formal charge, etc.) and bond (e.g., bond order, aromaticity, etc.) descriptors. These descriptors are encoded automatically with RDKit. The initial representation is refined by passing updates along nodes (i.e., atoms) and edges (i.e., bonds) in the molecular graph. Because SMILES strings fully encode connectivity, the provided SMILES strings may be used to construct a molecular graph representing each molecule. This graph is then updated via message passing steps. After learning an optimal representation for each molecule through message passing, this \"learned representation\" is passed as an input to an FFN for final property prediction.\n"

    "### Step 1: prediction coordination from SMILES\n",
    "The trained machine learning models may be conveniently loaded to predict metal-ligand coordination from SMILES inputs. The two properties pydentate predicts are \"coordination number\" and \"coordinating atoms\". Coordination number is a molecular property, and refers to the number of bonds a ligand forms with a metal, and is closely related to the more well-known topics of denticity (number of discontinuous atoms which bind to a metal, such as in the bidentate bipyridine ligand) and hapticity (number of continuous atoms which bind to a metal, such as in the monodentate haptic cyclopentadiene ligand). Coordinating atoms are atom-level properties, and refer to whether or not a given atom in a ligand directly binds to a metal."

Visualizing the ligand in RDKit and highlighting the predicted coordinating atoms, we see the nitrogen and oxygen atoms are predicted to bind to a metal.
